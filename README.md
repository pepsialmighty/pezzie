# Pezzie Assignment

This project is created by React and TypeScript.

## How to use

### The application allows user posts new notification by typing content into the text input. The input uses debouncing technique to increase the app performance so it is best not to click the send button immediately after the content is typed.

### The three newest notifications will be showed and the oldest one will be removed when there are alreay three notifications.

### User can edit or delete the notification as they want by clicking the vert icon at the top right of the notification.

### Each notification will have a timestamp to show the how many minute has passed since the post time. And if the post time exceeds 1 hour then it will show the exact date and time the notification was created.
